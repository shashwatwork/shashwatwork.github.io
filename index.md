Outside of Data Science, my interests are:
- Traveling 
- Blogging
- Reading/Learning
- Entrepreneurship

I have a Bachelor Degree as well as  Masters Degree in Computer Applications from the University of Rajasthan and VIT,Vellore respectively.During my Graduation Days I was very fascinated about AI/ML and decided to follow my passion towards AI and joined Virtusa as ML Engineer.

I am Technical Blogger and Open Source Contributer.Also Member of Open Data Science Community for contribution to various open source porjects.
 My technical interests are:
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Statistics
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Predictive Analysis
- Pattern Recognition
- AWS(RDS,CI/CD,EC2,Beanstalk etc.)

I started this Blog because:
- I believe that  Breaking down everything before learning is a good practice.So whatever I learn i project it as Blog.
- Data Science is moving fast. Reading about AI-related news could be a full-time job. I learn best by doing projects. So I post most of them here.
- I forget stuff, so it's always good to have them written down in a single place.
- If this blog can help someone else, this really makes my day.

You can find [here](https://shashwatt.github.io/blog/) a list of all the articles I have written.

All codes and exercises of this website are hosted on GitHub in a dedicated repository:

You can [contact me](mailto:stiwari2719n@gmail.com) if you think we could work together on an article or a project, or if you have any question/remark. If you would like to get to know more about me and my projects, feel free to check out my [resume](https://shashwatwork.github.io/assets/files/CV.pdf). I'm uploading articles that I'm writing in my free time. I'm trying to upload one article per month on average.

This website is adapted from [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme for Jekyll. I have essentially modified some layout elements, the video layer, the pulsing arrow in the home page and some widgets. If you would like to use it for your own blog, feel free to fork the repository.
